O speak.

Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
extorted treasure in the womb of earth...

127
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,375
...for, they say,

We do it wrong, being so majestical,
to offer it the show of violence...

133
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,857
...for it is as the air invulnerable...

It was about to speak
when the cock crew.

the cock, that is the trumpet to the morn...

139
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:24,086
...doth with his lofty
and shrill-sounding throat...

140
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,714
...awake the god of day...

141
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:31,427
...and at his warning,
whether in sea or fire, in earth or air...

142

...th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
to his confine.

00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:04,369
So excellent a king, that was to this...

307
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,622
...Hyperion to a satyr...

308
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,249
...so loving to my mother...

309
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,918
...that he might not
beteem the winds of heaven...

310
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,212
...visit her face too roughly.

311
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,674
Heaven and earth, must I remember?

312
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:22,262
Why, she would hang on him
as if increase of appetite had grown...

313
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,056
...by what it fed on,
and yet within a month--

314
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,892
Let me not think on't.

315
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,310
Frailty, thy name is woman.

316
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,980
A little month,
or ere those shoes were old...

317
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,482
...with which she followed
my poor father's body...

318
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,487
...like Niobe, all tears,
why she, even she--

319
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,325
O God, a beast
that wants discourse of reason...

320
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,368
...would have mourned longer.

321
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,913
--married with mine uncle...

322
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,373
...my father's brother...

323
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,876
...but no more like my father
than I to Hercules...

324
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,253
...within a month...

325
00:20:55,504 --> 00:21:01,676
...ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
had left the flushing in her galled eyes...

326
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,679
...she married.

327
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:09,309
O most wicked speed...

328
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:15,982
...to post with such dexterity
to incestuous sheets.

329
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,486
lt is not...

330
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:24,074
...nor it cannot come to good.

331
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,704
But break, my heart...

332
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,958
...for I must hold my tongue.

333
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,879
Hail to your lordship.

334
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,715
I am glad to see thee well.

335
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,429
Horatio.

336
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,141
Or I do forget myself.

337
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,852
The same, my lord,
and your poor servant ever.

338
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,939
Sir, my good friend,
I’ll change that name with you.

339
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:59,317
And what make you from Wittenberg,
Horatio? Marcellus.

340
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,569
-My good lord.
-l am very glad to see you.

341
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,946
Good even, sir.

342
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,198
But what in faith
make you from Wittenberg?

343
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,075
A truant disposition, good my lord.

344
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,745
I would not hear your enemy say so,
nor shall you do my ear that violence...

345
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:14,958
...to make it truster of your own report
against yourself. I know you are no truant.

346
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:18,169
But what is your affair in Elsinore?

347
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,423
We'll teach you to drink deep
ere you depart.

348
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,758
My lord, I came to see
your father's funeral.

349
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:27,929
I pray thee do not mock me, fellow student.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

350
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,266
-Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
-Thrift, thrift, Horatio.

351
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:36,062
The funeral baked meats
did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.

352
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:41,359
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
ere I had ever seen that day, Horatio.

353
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,739
My father.

354
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,285
Methinks I see my father.

355
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,454
Where, my lord?

356
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,875
In my mind's eye, Horatio.

357
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,837
I saw him once.

358
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,466
He was a goodly king.

359
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,052
He was a man.

360
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,180
Take him for all in all...

361
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,766
... I shall not look upon his like again.

362
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,642
My lord...

363
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,188
... I think...

364
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:24,110
... I saw him yesternight.

365
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,822
Saw?

366
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,034
Who?

367
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:34,496
My lord, the king...

368
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,832
...your father.

369
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,250
The king my father?

370
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,879
Season your admiration for a while
with an attent ear till I may deliver...

371
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,508
...upon the witness of these gentlemen,
this marvel to you.

372
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,177
For God's love, let me hear.

373
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,684
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch...

374
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,063
...in the dead waste and middle
of the night, been thus encountered.

375
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,858
A figure like your father,
armed at all points exactly, cap-a-pie...

376
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,444
...appears before them,
and with solemn march...

377
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,321
...goes slow and stately by them.

378
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,741
Thrice he walked by their oppressed
and fear-surprised eyes...

379
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,953
...within his truncheon's length,
whilst they distilled...

380
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:19,707
...almost to jelly with the act of fear,
stand dumb and speak not to him.

381
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,669
This to me in dreadful secrecy
impart they did...

382
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,421
...and I with them the third night
kept the watch...

383
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,634
...where, as they had delivered,
both in time...

384
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:33,179
...form of the thing,
each word made true and good...

385
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,265
...the apparition comes.

386
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,226
I knew your father.

387
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:41,104
-These hands are not more like.
-But where was this?

388
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,064
Upon the platform where we watched.

389
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,108
-Did you not speak to it?
-My lord, I did.

390
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,652
But answer made it none.
Yet once methought...

391
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,656
...it lifted up its head and did address
itself to motion like as it would speak...

392
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,242
...but even then the morning cock
crew loud...

393
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,454
...and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
and vanished from our sight.

394
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,998
'Tis very strange.

395
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,418
As I do live, my honor'd lord, 'tis true.

396
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,421
We did think it writ down in our duty
to let you know of it.

397
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,715
Indeed, indeed, sirs.

398
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,885
But this troubles me.

399
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,720
Hold you the watch tonight?

400
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,096
-We do.
-Armed, say you?

401
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,806
BOTH: Armed, my lord.
-From top to toe?

402
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,184
-From head to foot.
-Then saw you not his face.

403
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,394
O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.

404
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,396
What looked he? Frowningly?

405
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,524
-Countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
-Pale, or red?

406
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,651
-Very pale.
-And fix'd his eyes upon you?

407
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:29,819
Most constantly.

408
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,696
I would I had been there.

409
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,158
-It would have much amazed you.
-Very like...

410
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,619
...very like.

411
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,247
-Stayed it long?
-With moderate haste might tell a hundred.

412
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,416
-Longer, longer.
-Not when I saw't.

413
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,210
His beard was grizzled, no?

414
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,880
It was as I have seen it in his life
a sable silver'd.

415
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,549
I will watch tonight.

416
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,093
Perchance 'twill walk again.

417
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,762
I warrant you it will.

418
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,307
If it assume my noble father's person...

419
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:03,436
... I’ll speak to it though hell itself
should gape...

420
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,980
...and bid me hold my peace.

421
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,485
I pray you all,
if you have hitherto concealed this sight...

422
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,696
...let it be tenable in your silence still...

423
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,699
...and whatsoever else
shall hap tonight...

424
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,744
...give it an understanding but no tongue.

425
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,413
I will requite your loves.

426
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:23,998
So fare you well.

427
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:31,881
Upon the platform 'twixt 11 and 12
I’ll visit you.

428
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:37,762
-Our duty to your honor.
-Your loves, as mine to you.

429
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,764
Farewell.

430
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,976
HAMLET:
My father's spirit in arms.

431
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,144
All is not well.

432
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,146
I doubt some foul play.

433
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,023
Would the night were come.

434
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:53,278
Till then, sit still, my soul.

435
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,493
Foul deeds will rise...

436
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:06,416
...though all the earth o'erwhelm them,
to men's eyes.

437
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,594
My necessaries are embarked. Farewell.

438
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:24,058
And sister, as the winds give benefit
and convoy is assistant, do not sleep...

439
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,643
...but let me hear from you.

440
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,229
Do you doubt that?

441
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:36,112
For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favor,
hold it a fashion and a toy in blood...

442
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,576
...a violet in the youth of primy nature,
forward not permanent, sweet not lasting...

443
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,704
...the perfume and suppliance of a minute,
no more.

444
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,707
-No more but so?
-Think it no more.

445
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:51,502
For nature crescent does not grow alone
in thews and bulk...

446
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,131
...but as his temple waxes
the inward service of the mind and soul...

447
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,591
...grows wide withal.

448
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,218
Perhaps he loves you now...

449
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:04,932
...and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
the virtue of his will. But you must fear...

450
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,271
...his greatness weighed,
his will is not his own...

451
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,399
...for he himself is subject to his birth.

452
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,777
He may not, as unvalued persons do...

453
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,529
...carve for himself,
for on his choice depends...

454
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,240
...the sanity and health
of the whole state.

455
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,951
And therefore must his choice
be circumscribed...

456
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,581
...unto the voice and yielding of that body
whereof he is the head.

457
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:33,044
Then if he says he loves you,
it fits your wisdom so far to believe it...

458
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:37,632
...as he in his particular act and place
may give his saying deed...

459
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,553
...which is no further
than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.

460
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,473
Then weigh what loss
your honor may sustain...

...or lose your heart...

to his unmastered importunity.

Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister...

465
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:06,661
...and keep within the rear of your affection,
out of the shot and danger of desire.

466
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:11,833
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
if she unmask her beauty to the moon.

Virtue itself scapes not
calumnious strokes.

The canker galls the infants of the spring
too oft before their buttons be disclosed...

and liquid dew of youth...

470

...contagious blastments
are most imminent.

471

Be wary then. Best safety lies in fear.

472
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,898
Youth to itself rebels,
though none else near.

473
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:40,361
I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
as watchman to my heart.

474
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,741
But, good my brother,
do not, as some ungracious pastors do...

00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,286
...show me the steep
and thorny way to heaven...

476
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,913
...whilst like a puffed
and reckless libertine...

477
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,541
...himself the primrose path
of dalliance treads...

478
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,626
...and recks not his own rede.

479
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,796

And these few precepts in thy memory,
see thou character.

Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar.

and their adoption tried...

...grapple them to thy soul
with "hoops of steel"...

492
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,252
...but do not dull thy palm
with entertainment...

493
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,797
...of each new-hatched,
unfledged comrade.

494
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,885
Beware of entrance to a quarrel,
but being in...

495
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:49,472
...bear't that th' opposed
may beware of thee.

496
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,558
Give every man thine ear
but few thy voice.

497
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:56,479
Take each man's censure,
but reserve thy judgment.

498
00:30:56,647 --> 00:31:01,734
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
but not expressed in fancy.

499
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,903
Rich not gaudy.

500
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,405
For the apparel oft proclaims the man...

501
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,950
...and they in France
of the best rank and station...

502
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,370
...are of all most select
and generous chief in that.

503
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:15,581
Neither a borrower nor a lender be...

504
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,501
...for loan oft loses
both itself and friend...

505
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,755
...and borrowing dulls the edge
of husbandry.

506
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,800
This above all:

507
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,136
To thine own self be true...

508
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:34,642
...and it must follow, as the night the day,
thou canst not then be false to any man.

...that you have ta'en his tenders
for true pay, which are not sterling.

Tender yourself dearly...

From this time, be somewhat scanter
of your maiden presence.

believe so much in him, that he is young...

...and draw you into madness?

612
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,413
Think of it.
The very place puts toys of desperation...

613
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:33,334
...without more motive, into every brain
that looks so many fathoms to the sea...

614
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,835
...and hears it roar beneath.

615
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,922
-It wafts me still. Go on, I’ll follow thee.
-You shall not go.

616
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,591
-Hold off your hands.
-Be ruled. You shall not go.

617
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,843
My fate cries out.

618
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:46,931
And makes each petty artery in this body
as hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.

619
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,267
Still am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen.

620
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,604
By heav'n,
I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me.

621
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,773
I say, away!

622
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,902
Go on, I’ll follow thee.

623
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,906
-He waxes desperate with imagination.
-Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.

624
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:07,034
Have after. To what issue will this come?

625
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,954
Something is rotten
in the state of Denmark.

626
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,039
Heaven will direct it.

627
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,582
Nay, let's follow him.

628
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,627
HAMLET:
Angels and ministers of grace defend us.

629
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,879
Be thou a spirit of health
or goblin damned...

630
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,382
...bring airs from heaven
or blasts from hell...

631
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,885
...be thy intents wicked or charitable,
thou com'st in such a shape...

632
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,387
...that I will speak to thee.

633
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,640
I’ll call thee Hamlet,
king, father, royal Dane.

634
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,141
O answer me!

635
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,268
Let me not burst in ignorance...

636
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:37,690
...but tell why thy canonized bones,
hearsed in death...

637
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,316
...have burst their cerements...

638
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,486
...why the sepulcher
wherein we saw thee quietly inurned...

639
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,948
...hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws
to cast thee up again.

640
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,366
What may this mean...

641
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,244
...that thou, dead corpse,
again in complete steel...

642
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,747
...revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
making the night hideous...

643
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,917
...and we fools of nature
so horridly to shake our disposition...

644
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,294
...with thoughts beyond
the reaches of our souls?

645
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,296
Say, why is this? Wherefore?

646
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,881
What should we do?

647
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,761
Whither with thou lead me?

648
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,763
Speak.

649
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,807
I’ll go no further.

650
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,601
GHOST: Mark me.
HAMLET: I will.

651
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,812
GHOST:
My hour is almost come...

652
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,940
...when I to sulph'rous
and tormenting flames...

653
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,984
...must render up myself.

654
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,402
HAMLET:
Alas, poor ghost.

655
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:28,949
GHOST: Pity me not, but lend thy
serious hearing to what I shall unfold.

656
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,659
HAMLET:
Speak, I am bound to hear.

657
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,872
GHOST: So art thou to revenge
when thou shalt hear.

658
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,081
HAMLET:
What?

659
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,127
I am thy father's spirit...

660
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:43,839
...doomed for a certain term
to walk the night...

661
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:48,427
...and for the day
confined to fast in fires...

662
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:52,306
...till the foul crimes
done in my days of nature...

663
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:55,642
...are burnt and purged away.

664
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:01,899
But that I am forbid
to tell the secrets of my prison-house...

665
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:06,153
... I could a tale unfold
whose lightest word...

666
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:10,365
...would harrow up thy soul,
freeze thy young blood...

667
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:15,204
...make thy two eyes like stars
start from their spheres...

668
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,373
...thy knotted and combined locks
to part...

669
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,377
...and each particular hair
to stand on end...

670
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:26,423
...like quills upon the fretful porcupine.

671
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:32,679
But this eternal blazon must not be
to ears of flesh and blood.

672
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:38,769
List, Hamlet, list, O list.

673
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:44,024
-If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
-Oh, God!

674
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,986
Revenge his foul
and most unnatural murder.

675
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:53,867
-Murder?
-Murder most foul, as in the best it is...

676
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:59,498
...but this most foul, strange,
and unnatural.

677
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:00,833
Haste me to know it...

678
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,378
...that I with wings as swift
as meditation or the thoughts of love...

679
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,338
...may sweep to my revenge.

680
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:07,589
I find thee apt...

681
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,509
...and duller shouldst thou be
than the fat weed...

682
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:16,140
...that roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
wouldst thou not stir in this.

683
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,016
Now, Hamlet, hear.

684
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,936
'Tis given out that,
sleeping in mine orchard...

685
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,063
...a serpent stung me.

686
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,066
So the whole ear of Denmark...

687
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:31,363
...is by a forged process of my death
rankly abused.

688
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:35,993
But know, thou noble youth,
the serpent that did sting thy father's life...

689
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,704
...now wears his crown.

690
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:42,040
O my prophetic soul. Mine uncle?

691
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:47,754
GHOST: Ay, that incestuous,
that adulterate beast...

692
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:52,759
...with witchcraft of his wit,
with traitorous gifts--

693
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:58,765
O wicked wit and gifts,
that have the power so to seduce.

694
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,852
--won to his shameful lust...

695
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:07,691
...the will of my most
seeming-virtuous queen.

696
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,485
O Hamlet...

697
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,406
...what a falling-off was there.

698
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:20,537
From me, whose love was of that dignity
that it went hand-in-hand...

699
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:24,708
...even with the vow
I made to her in marriage...

700
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,961
...and to decline upon a wretch...

701
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:32,299
...whose natural gifts were poor
to those of mine.

702
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,802
But virtue, as it never will be moved...

703
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,431
...though lewdness court it
in a shape of heaven...

704
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,518
...so lust,
though to a radiant angel linked...

705
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,939
...will sate itself in a celestial bed...

706
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,484
...and prey on garbage.

707
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:53,487
But soft, methinks I scent
the morning's air.

708
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,364
Brief let me be.

709
00:42:55,531 --> 00:43:01,203
Sleeping within mine orchard,
my custom always in the afternoon...

710
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:05,582
...upon my secure hour thy uncle stole...

711
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,503
...with juice of cursed hebenon
in a vial...

712
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:14,716
...and in the porches of mine ears did pour
the leprous distilment...

713
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:18,679
...whose effect
holds such an enmity with blood of man...

714
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,098
...that swift as quicksilver...

715
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:25,644
...it courses through
the natural gates and alleys of the body...

716
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,480
...and with a sudden vigor
it doth posset...

717
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:35,028
...and curd, like eager droppings into milk,
the thin and wholesome blood.

718
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,364
So did it mine.

719
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:41,076
And a most instant tetter barked about...

720
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:45,122
...most lazar-like,
with vile and loathsome crust...

721
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,209
...all my smooth body.

722
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:53,505
Thus was I, sleeping...

723
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,258
...by a brother's hand...

724
00:43:56,426 --> 00:44:00,137
...of life, of crown, of queen...

725
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:03,140
...at once dispatched...

726
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:07,936
...cut off
even in the blossoms of my sin...

727
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:14,109
...unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled...

728
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:18,739
...no reckoning made,
but sent to my account...

729
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:23,702
...with all my imperfections on my head.

730
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:27,080
O horrible...

731
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:30,584
...O horrible...

732
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:34,087
...most horrible.

733
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,883
If thou has nature in thee, bear it not.

734
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:43,889
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
a couch for luxury and damned incest.

735
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:47,559
But howsoever thou pursuest this act...

736
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:50,604
...taint not thy mind...

737
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:56,360
...nor let thy soul contrive
against thy mother aught.

738
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,612
Leave her to heaven...

739
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,324
...and to those thorns
that in her bosom lodge...

740
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:06,119
...to prick and sting her.

741
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,621
Fare thee well at once.

742
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:12,751
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
and 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.

743
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:16,171
Adieu, adieu, Hamlet.

744
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:19,591
Remember me.

745
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:28,058
O all you host of heaven.

746
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:36,066
O earth. What else?

747
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:40,654
And shall I couple hell?

748
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,074
O fie.

749
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:48,745
Hold, hold, my heart...

750
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:54,960
...and you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
but bear me stiffly up.

751
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:57,295
Remember thee?

752
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:02,676
Ay, thou poor ghost...

753
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:06,888
...whilst memory holds a seat
in this distracted globe.

754
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,516
Remember thee? Yea...

755
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:14,187
...from the table of my memory
I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records...

756
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:18,275
...all saws of books, all forms,
all pressures past...

757
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,902
...that youth and observation
copied there...

758
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:26,700
...and thy commandment all alone shall live
within the book and volume of my brain...

759
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,077
...unmixed with baser matter.

760
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,580
Yes, by heaven.

761
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:35,834
O most pernicious woman!

762
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,629
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain.

763
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,548
My tables...

764
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:46,511
...meet it is I set it down
that one may smile and smile and be a villain.

765
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,555
At least I'm sure
it may be so in Denmark.

766

POLONIUS:
How now, Ophelia, what's the matter?

922
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,975
Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted.

With what, in the name of God?

My lord, as I was sewing
in my chamber...

925
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,525
...Lord Hamlet,
with his doublet all unbraced...

926
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:23,194
...no hat upon his head,
his stockings fouled...

927
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,947
...ungartered, and down-gyved
to his ankle...

00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:29,742
...pale as his shirt,
his knees knocking each other...

...and with a look so piteous in purport...

930

...as if he had been loosed out of hell
to speak of horrors...

931
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,375
...he comes before me.

00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,586
-Mad for thy love?
-My lord, I do not know.

00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,089
-But truly I do fear it.
-What said he?

934
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:47,760
He took me by the wrist
and held me hard...

935
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,763
...then goes he to the length
of all his arm...

936
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:54,559
...and with his other hand
thus o'er his brow...

937
00:55:54,727 --> 00:56:00,189
...he falls to such perusal of my face
as 'a would draw it.

938
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,943
Long stayed he so.

939

At last, a little shaking of mine arm...

940
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:12,785
...and thrice his head
thus waving up and down...

941
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:17,540
...he raised a sigh
so piteous and profound...

942
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:23,463
...that it did seem to shatter all his bulk
and end his being.

943
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:27,216
That done, he lets me go...

...and, with his head
over his shoulder turned...

945

...he seemed to find his way
without his eyes...

No, my good lord,
but as you did command...

to be a preparation 'gainst the Polack.

But better looked into, he truly found
it was against Your Highness.

...was falsely borne in hand,
sends out arrests...

...on Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys,
receives rebuke from Norway...

...and, in fine,
makes vow before his uncle never more...

...to give th' essay of arms

...gives him 3000 crowns in annual fee...

1033
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,978
...and his commission
to employ those soldiers...

1034
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:16,399
...so levied as before,
'gainst the Polack...

1035
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:20,111

...that it might please you to give quiet pass
through your dominions for his enterprise...

...on such regards of safety and allowance
as therein are set down.

1038

01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:38,754
And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
answer, and think upon this business.

what majesty should be, what duty is...

1045

...why day is day, night night,
and time is time...

1046
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:03,737
...were nothing but to waste
night, day, and time.

1047
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,866
Therefore, since brevity
is the soul of wit...

1048
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:10,453
...and tediousness the limbs
and outward flourishes...

1049

Your noble son is mad.

1051
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:22,756
"Mad" call I it, for to define true madness,
what is't but to be nothing else but mad?

1052
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:26,010
-But let that go.
-More matter with less art.

1053
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:28,888
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.

1054
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,474
That he is mad, 'tis true.

1055
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,810
'Tis true 'tis pity, and pity 'tis 'tis true.

1056
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:40,274
A foolish figure,
but farewell it, for I will use no art.

1057
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:42,193
Mad let us grant him, then.

1058
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,362
And now remains
that we find out the cause of this effect.

1059
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:50,910
Or rather say "the cause of this defect,"
for this effect defective comes by cause.

...the...

1068
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:22,942
...celestial and my soul's idol...

1069
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:28,405
...the most beautified Ophelia."

1070
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,783
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase...

1071
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:32,618
..."beautified" is a vile phrase.

1072
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:33,953
But you shall hear.

1073
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,289
"These...

1074
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,626


...in...

1075
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,463
...her excellent...

1076
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,509
...white bosom, these."

1077
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,514
Came this from Hamlet to her?

1078
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:57,017
Good madam, stay awhile.
I will be faithful.

1079
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:01,855
"Doubt thou the stars are fire,
doubt that the sun doth move...

1080
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:05,150
...doubt truth to be a liar,
but never doubt I love."

1081
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,320
Dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers.

1082
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,906
I have not art to reckon my groans.

1083
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,450
But that I love thee best...

1084
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:19,164
...O most best, believe it.

1085
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,126
Adieu, adieu.

1086
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,382
Thine evermore....

1087
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:32,928
"Most dear lady,
whilst this machine is to him, Hamlet."

1088
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,015
This in obedience
hath my daughter showed me...

1089
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,183
...and more above hath his solicitings...

1090
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,686
...as they fell out by time,
by means, and place...

1091
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,062
...all given to mine ear.

1092
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,814
How hath she receiv'd his love?

1093
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:47,067
-What do you think of me?
-As of a man faithful and honorable.

1094
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,819
I would fain prove so.

1095
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:52,197
But what might you think,
when I had seen this hot love on the wing...

1096
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,825
...as I perceived it,
before my daughter told me...

1097
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:59,163
...what might you, or your queen, think
if I had played the desk or table-book?

1098
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:01,415
Or given my heart
a winking mute and dumb?

1099
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,209
Or looked upon this with idle sight,
what might you think?

1100
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:09,048
No, I went round to work,
and my young mistress thus I did bespeak:

1101
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,551
"Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star.
This must not be."

1102
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,305
And then I precepts gave her,
that she should lock herself from his resort...

1103
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,432
...admit no messengers,
receive no tokens.

1104
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,768
Which done, she took
the fruits of my advice...

1105
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:25,814
...and he, repulsed-- A short tale to make.
--fell into a sadness, then into a fast...

1106
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,275
...thence to a watch,
thence into a weakness...

1107
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:32,404
...thence to a likeness, by this declension,
into the madness wherein now he raves...

1108
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:33,572
...and we wail for.

1109
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:39,787
-Do you think 'tis this?
-It may be. Very like.

1110
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,247
Hath there been such a time--
I'd fain know that.

1111
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,000
--that I have said, "'Tis so,"
when it proved otherwise?

1112
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:49,046
-Not that I know.
-Take this from this if this be otherwise.

1113
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:51,882
If circumstances lead me I will find
where truth is hid...

1114
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,176
...though it were hid indeed
within the center.

1115
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,803
How may we try it further?

1116
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,848
You know, sometimes he walks
four hours together here in the lobby.

1117
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,433
So he does indeed.

1118
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:03,811
At such a time,
I’ll loose my daughter to him.

1119
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,522
Be you and I behind an arras then.
Mark the encounter.

1120
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:10,109
If he love her not
and be not from his reason fall'n thereon...

1121
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:14,113
...let me be no assistant for a state,
but keep a farm and carters.

1122
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,572
-We will try it.
-But look...

1123
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,951
...oh, where sadly the poor wretch
comes reading.

1124
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:22,955
Away, I do beseech you, both away.
I’ll board him presently.

1125
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,875
O give me leave.

1126
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,548
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

1127
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,341
[GASPS]

1128
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:40,222
Well, God-a-mercy.

1129
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,186
Do you know me, my lord?

1130
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:48,814
Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.

1131
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,900
-Not I, my lord.
-Then I would you were so honest a man.

1132
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,318
-Honest, my lord?
-Ay, sir.

1133
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:58,323
To be honest, as this world goes,
is to be one man picked out of 10,000.

1134
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,742
That's very true, my lord.

1135
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,619
For if the sun breed maggots
in a dead dog...

1136
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,998
...being a god kissing carrion.

1137
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,375
Have you a daughter?

1138
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,002
I have, my lord.

1139
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,087
Let her not walk i' the sun.

1140
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:17,176
Conception is a blessing,
but as your daughter may conceive....

1141
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,927
Friend...

1142
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:22,097
...look to it.

1143
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,019
How say you by that?

1144
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:29,730
Still harping on my daughter.

1145
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,024
Yet he knew me not at first.

1146
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:33,984
He said I was a fishmonger.

1147
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,862
He is far gone, far gone.

1148
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:40,532
And truly in my youth
I suffered much extremity for love...

1149
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,701
...very near this.

1150
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:45,704
I’ll speak to him again.

1151
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,874
-What do you read, my lord?
-Words.

1152
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,751
Words.

1153
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:54,087
-Words.
-What is the matter, my lord?

1154
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:56,215
-Between who?
-I mean the matter you read.

1155
01:08:56,382 --> 01:09:01,887
Slanders, sir. For the satirical rogue
says here that old men have gray beards...

1156
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,680
...that their faces are wrinkled...

1157
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:07,351
...their eyes purging thick amber
and plum-tree gum...

1158
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:11,104
...and that they have a plentiful lack of wit,
together with most weak hams.

1159
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,732
All which, sir,
though I most powerfully believe...

1160
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,401
...yet I hold it not honesty to have it
thus set down.

1161
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,196
For you yourself, sir,
shall grow old as I am...

1162
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:23,909
...if, like a crab, you could go backward.

1163
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,370
Though this be madness,
yet there is method in 't.

1164
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:29,081
-Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
-Into my grave?

1165
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,875
Indeed, that is out of the air.

1166
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:36,713
How pregnant sometimes his replies are.

1167
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,299
A happiness
that often madness hits on...

1168
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:43,136
...which reason and sanity could not
so prosperously be delivered of.

1169
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,264
I will leave him, and suddenly contrive...

1170
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:48,767
...the means of meeting
between him and my daughter.

1171
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:54,690
My lord?

1172
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:57,776
My lord, I will take my leave of you.

1173
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:01,738
You cannot, sir, take from me anything
I would more willingly part withal.

1174
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:09,621
Except my life.

1175
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:11,790
Fare you well, my lord.

1176
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,793
These tedious old fools.

1177
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,590
My honored lord!

1178
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,468
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet.
There he is.

My most dear lord.

HAMLET:
My excellent good friends.

1183
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:42,195
How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Rosencrantz?

1184
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:43,614
Good lads, how do ye both?

1185
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,657
As the indifferent children of the earth.

1186
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:49,745
Happy in that we are not over-happy,
on Fortune's cap we are not the very button.

1187
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:52,331
-Nor the soles of her shoes?
-Neither, my lord.

1188
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:55,000
You live about her waist,
in the middle of her favors?

1189
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:56,877
Faith, her privates we.

1190
01:10:57,045 --> 01:11:00,464
In the secret parts of Fortune? Most true,
she is a strumpet. What news?

1191
01:11:00,632 --> 01:11:03,634
None, my lord,
but that the world's grown honest.

1192
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,177
Then is doomsday near.

1193
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:07,971
But your news is not true.
Let me question in particular.

1194
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,642
What have you deserved at the hands
of Fortune that she sends you to prison?

1195
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,352
-Prison?
-Denmark's a prison.

1196
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,228
-Then is the world one.
-A goodly one.

1197
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:18,023
In which there are many confines,
wards and dungeons...

1198
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:22,069
-...Denmark being one of the worst.
-We think not so, my lord.

1199
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,196
Why, then 'tis none to you...

1200
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:29,493
...for there is nothing either good or bad
but thinking makes it so.

1201
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:30,994
To me it is a prison.

1202
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:35,958
Why, then your ambition makes it one.
'Tis too narrow for your mind.

1203
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,710
O God, I could be bounded
in a nutshell...

1204
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:41,713
...and count myself
a king of infinite space...

...were it not that I have bad dreams.

1206
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:46,802
Which dreams indeed are ambition.

1207
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:50,305
For the very substance of the ambitious
is merely the shadow of a dream.

1208
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:51,890
A dream itself is but a shadow.

1209
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,559
And I hold ambition
of so airy and light a quality...

1210
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,186
...it is but a shadow's shadow.

1211
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,021
Well, then are our beggars bodies...

1212
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:01,149
...and our monarchs and outstretched
heroes the beggars' shadows.

For, by my fay, I cannot reason.

-We'll wait upon you.
-No such matter.

I will not sort you with the rest
of my servants...

1216
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:17,290
...for, to speak to you like an honest man,
I am most dreadfully attended.

But in the beaten way of friendship,
what make you at Elsinore?

01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,757
To visit you, my lord. No other occasion.

1219
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,301
Beggar that I am,
I am even poor in thanks...

1220
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,387
...but I thank you.

1221
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:34,474
And sure, dear friends,
my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.

1222
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:38,395
Were you not sent for?
Is it your own inclining?

1223
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,105
Is it a free visitation?

1224
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:43,358
Come, deal justly with me.

1225
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,736
Come, come. Nay, speak.

1226
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,237
What should we say, my lord?

1227
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,489
Why, anything but to th' purpose!

1228
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:51,116
You were sent for.

1229
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:55,037
There is a confession in your looks, which
your modesties have not craft to color.

1230
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:58,248
-The king and queen have sent for you.
-To what end, my lord?

1231
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,083
That you must teach me.

1232
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,711
Let me conjure you,
by the rights of our fellowship...

1233
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,546
...by the consonancy of our youth...

1234
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:07,507
...by the obligation
of our ever-preserved love...

1235
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:11,803
...and by what more dear a better proposer
can charge you withal...

1236
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:17,350
...be even and direct with me
whether you were sent for or no.

1237
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:22,272
-What say you?
-Nay, then, I have an eye of you.

1238
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:26,359
If you love me, hold not off.

1239
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:31,198
My lord, we were sent for.

1240

HAMLET:
I will tell you why.

1241
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,331
So shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery...

1242
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:44,461
...and your secrecy
to the king and queen molt no feather.

1243
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:48,048
I have of late--

1244
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:50,175
But wherefore I know not.

1245
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:56,348
--lost all my mirth,
forgone all custom of exercise.

1246
01:13:56,516 --> 01:14:00,185
And indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition...

1247
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:05,232
...that this goodly frame, the earth...

1248
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:08,860
...seems to me a sterile promontory.

1249
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:11,863
This most excellent canopy, the air...

1250
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:16,535
...look you,
this brave o'erhanging firmament...

1251
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:20,705
...this majestical roof...

1252
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,917
...fretted with golden fire.

1253
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:26,128
Why, it appears no other thing to me...

1254
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:32,551
...but a foul and pestilent
congregation of vapors.

1255
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:37,430
What a piece of work is a man.

1256
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,641
How noble in reason...

1257
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,477
...how infinite in faculties...

1258
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:47,899
...in form and moving
how express and admirable...

1259
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:51,736
...in action how like an angel...

1260
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:56,449
...in apprehension how like a god...

...the beauty of the world...

1262
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:00,245
...the paragon of animals.

1263
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:03,957
And yet, to me...

1264
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:08,587
...what is this quintessence...

1265
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,506
...of dust?

1266
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:17,596
Man delights not me.

1267
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:22,267
No, nor woman neither,
though by your smiling you seem to say so.

1268
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,644
My lord, there was no such stuff
in my thoughts.

1269
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:28,315
Why did you laugh, then,
when I said, "Man delights not me"?

1270
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:32,736
To think, my lord,
if you delight not in man...

1271
01:15:32,904 --> 01:15:36,573
...what Lenten entertainment
the players shall receive from you.

1272
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:40,118
We coted them on the way and hither
are they coming to offer you service.

1273
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:42,412
He that plays the king shall be welcome.

1274

His Majesty shall have tribute of me.

1275
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:48,752
The adventurous knight
shall use his foil and target...

1276
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,837
...the lover shall not sigh gratis...

1277
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,465
...the humorous man
shall end his part in peace...

1278
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:57,052
...the clown shall make those laugh
whose lungs are tickled o' th' sere...

1279
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:00,931
...and the lady shall speak her mind freely,
or the blank verse shall halt for it.

1280
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,016
What players are they?

1281
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:06,519
ROSENCRANTZ: Even those you were wont
to take delight in, the tragedians of the city.

1282
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:07,938
How chances it they travel?

1283
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:11,608
Their residence, both in reputation
and profit, was better both ways.

1284
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:14,486
Their inhibition comes
by the means of the late innovation.

1285
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:17,239
They hold the estimation
they did when I was in the city?

1286
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,282
-Are they so followed?
-They are not.

1287
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,409
HAMLET:
Well, how comes it? Do they grow rusty?

1288
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,536
Their endeavor
keeps in the wonted pace.

1289
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,664
But there is, sir, an aerie of children...

1290
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:29,834
...little eyases that cry out on the top
of question and are clapped for it.

1291
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,336
These are now the fashion...

1292
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,588
...and so berattle the common stages...

1293
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:37,467
...that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goose-quills and scarce come thither.

1294
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:40,637
Are they children? Who maintains 'em?
How are they escoted?

1295
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:44,057
Will they pursue the quality
no longer than they can sing?

1296
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:47,602
Will they not say afterwards, if they
grow themselves to common players--

1297
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,021
As it is most like,
if their means are no better.

1298
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:54,317
--their writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim against their own succession?

1299
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:57,028
Faith, there has been much to-do
on both sides.

1300
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,906
The nation holds it no sin
to tarre them to controversy.

1301
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:04,160
There was no money bid for argument
unless the poet and player went to cuffs.

1302
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:06,997
-Is't possible?
-There has been much throwing of brains.

1303
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:09,082
And do the boys carry it away?

1304
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,919
ROSENCRANTZ: Ay, that they do,
my lord, Hercules and his load too.

1305
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,838
Well, it is not very strange.

1306
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:17,048
For mine uncle is king of Denmark...

1307
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:20,302
...and those that would make mouths at him
while my father lived...

1308
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:24,306
...give 20, 40, 50, a hundred ducats
apiece for his picture in little.

There are the players.

You are welcome to Elsinore.

1314
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,157
Your hands. The appurtenance of welcome
is fashion and ceremony.

1315
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:45,577
Let me comply with you in this garb,
lest my extent to the players--

1316
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:47,329
Which must show fairly outwards.

1317
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,831
--should more appear like entertainment
than yours.

But my uncle-father and aunt-mother
are deceived.

In what, my dear lord?

1320
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,837
I am but mad north-north-west.

I know a hawk from a handsaw.

Well be with you, gentlemen.

At each ear a hearer.

My lord, I have news to tell you.

1330
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:23,656
-When Roscius was an actor in Rome--
-The actors are come hither, my lord.

-Buzz, buzz.
-Upon mine honor--

1332
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,243
Then came each actor on his ass.

1333

Seneca cannot be too heavy,
nor Plautus too light.

For the law of writ and the liberty,
these are the only men.

01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:46,346
O Jephthah, judge of Israel,
what a treasure hadst thou.

1339
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:47,972
What a treasure had he, my lord?

1340
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:52,018
Why, "One fair daughter and no more,
the which he loved passing well."

1341
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:54,979
-Still on my daughter.
-Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?

01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:04,549
...or if it was, not above once.

1367
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:07,510
For the play, I remember,
pleased not the million.

1368
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,804
'Twas caviar to the general.

1369
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,514
But it was-- As I received it...

1370
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:15,643
...and others whose judgments
in such matters cried in the top of mine.

1371
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,521
--an excellent play,
well-digested in the scenes...

1372
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,690
...set down with as much modesty
as cunning.

1373
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:25,069
I remember one said there were no sallets
in the lines to make the matter savory...

1374
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,988
...nor no matter in the phrase...

1375
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:30,241
...which might indict
the author of affectation...

1376
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,243
...but called it an honest method...

1377
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:36,331
...as wholesome as sweet,
and by very much more handsome than fine.

1378
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:40,585
One speech in it I chiefly loved,
'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido...

1379
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:44,881
...and thereabout of it especially
where he speaks of Priam's slaughter.

1380
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:47,425
If it live in your memory,

Let me see, let me see:

1382
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:56,893
The rugged Pyrrhus,
like th' Hyrcanian beast--

1383
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,562
-It 'tis not so.
-It begins with Pyrrhus.

1384
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:01,231
It begins with Pyrrhus.

1385
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:05,193
The rugged Pyrrhus,
he whose sable arms...

1386
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,987
...black as his purpose,
did the night resemble...

1387
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:10,949
...when he lay couch'd
In the ominous horse...

1388
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:14,661
...hath now this dread
and black complexion smeared...

1389
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,455
...with heraldry more dismal.

1390
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:23,294
-Head to foot now is he total gules...
ALL: Gules.

1391
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:27,924
...horridly tricked with blood of fathers,
mothers, daughters, sons...

1392
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,343
...baked and impasted
with the parching streets...

1393
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:34,013
...that lend a tyrannous and damned light
to their lord's murder.

1394
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:35,807
Roasted in wrath and fire...

1395
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:38,351
...and thus o'er-sized
with coagulate gore...

1396
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:41,479
...with eyes like carbuncles
the hellish Pyrrhus...

1397
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:45,984
...old grandsire Priam seeks.

1398
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:51,739
So proceed you.

1399
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:59,914
Fore God, my lord, well-spoken,
with good accent and good discretion.

1400
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:04,669
Anon he finds him...

1401
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,589
...striking too short at Greeks.

1402
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:12,885
His antique sword, rebellious to his arm,
lies where it falls...

1403
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,305
...repugnant to command.

1404
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:18,182
Unequal match,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives...

1405
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,767
...in rage strikes wide.

1406
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,478
But with the whiff and wind
of his fell sword...

1407
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:24,480
...th' unnerved father falls.

1408
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,190
Then senseless Ilium...

1409
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:29,527
...seeming to feel his blow,
with flaming top...

1410
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:32,864
...stoops to his base,
and with a hideous crash...

1411
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,825
...takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear.

1412
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:38,870
For lo, his sword,
which was declining on the milky head...

1413
01:22:39,038 --> 01:22:41,873
...of reverend Priam,
seemed i' th' air to stick.

1414
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:45,543
So as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood...

1415
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:49,672
...and like a neutral to his will and matter,
did nothing.

1416
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:53,176
But as we often see
against some storm...

1417
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:57,805
...a silence in the heavens,
the rack stand still...

1418
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,475
...the bold winds speechless...

1419
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:06,022
...and the orb below as hush as death...

1420
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:09,859
...anon the dreadful thunder
doth rend the region.

1421
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:14,280
So after Pyrrhus' pause,
a roused vengeance sets him new a-work.

1422
01:23:14,448 --> 01:23:16,908
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall...

1423
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:20,995
...on Mars his armor,
forged for proof eterne...

1424
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:24,624
...with less remorse
than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword...

1425
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:27,168
...now falls on Priam.

1426
01:23:27,378 --> 01:23:30,713
Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune!

1427

All you gods,
in general synod, take away her power...

1428
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:38,262
...break all the spokes and fellies
from her wheel...

1429
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:41,724
...and bowl the round nave
down the hill of heaven...

1430

But who,
O who had seen the mobbled queen.

Mobbled queen.

That's good. "Mobbled queen" is good.

...threat'ning the flames
with bisson rheum.

1442
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:21,097
A clout upon that head
where late the diadem stood...

01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:26,811

about her lank and all o're-teemed loins...

But if the gods themselves
did see her then...

1448
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:45,455
...when she saw Pyrrhus
make malicious sport...

1449

...in mincing with his sword
her husband's limbs...

01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:46,070
O, vengeance!

1517
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:54,537
What an ass am I?
This is most brave...

1518
01:28:54,705 --> 01:28:59,709
...that I, the son
of a dear father murdered...

1519
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:02,003
...prompted to my revenge
by heaven and hell...

1520
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:06,257
...must, like a whore,
unpack my heart with words...

1521
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:09,927
...and fall a-cursing like a very drab,
a scullion. Fie upon't, foh!

1522
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:12,471
About, my brain.

1523
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:16,642
I have heard
that guilty creatures sitting at a play...

1524
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:20,771
...have by the very cunning of the scene
been struck so to the soul that presently...

1525
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:23,691
...they have proclaimed
their malefactions.

1526
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:28,612
For murder, though it have no tongue,
will speak with most miraculous organ.

1527
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:33,993
I’ll have these players play something
like the murder of my father...

1528
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:39,290
...before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks,
I’ll tent him to the quick.

1529
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:43,836
If he but blench, I know my course.

1530
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:48,591
The spirit that I have seen
may be of the devil...

1531
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:51,802
...and the devil hath power
t'assume a pleasing shape.

1532
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:57,975
Yea, and perhaps,
out of my weakness and my melancholy--

1533
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:01,979
As he is very potent with such spirits.

1534
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:04,440
--abuses me...

1535
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,235
...to damn me.

1536
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:15,076
I’ll have grounds more relative than this.

1537
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:18,704
The play's the thing...

1538
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:24,043
...wherein I’ll catch the conscience
of the king.

1539
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:27,671
And can you by no drift of conference...

1540
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:31,008
...get from him
why he puts on this confusion...

1541
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:35,346
...grating so harshly all his days of quiet
with turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

1542
01:30:35,514 --> 01:30:38,265
He does confess
he feels himself distracted...

1543
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:40,684
...but from what cause
he will by no means speak.

1544
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,145
Nor do we find him forward
to be sounded...

1545
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:46,023
...but with a crafty madness
keeps aloof...

1546
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:48,526
...when we would bring him on
to some confession...

1547
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:49,693
...of his true state.

1548
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:53,114
-Did he receive you well?
ROSENCRANTZ: Most like a gentleman.

1549
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:56,659
But with much forcing of his disposition.

1550
01:30:56,827 --> 01:31:00,996
Niggard of question, but of our demands
most free in his reply.

1551
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:02,790
Did you assay him to any pastime?

1552
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,544
Madam, it so fell out that certain players
we o'er-raught on the way.

1553
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:10,381
Of these we told him,
there did seem in him a joy to hear of it.

1554
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:14,301
They are about the court, and they have
already order to play before him.

1555
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:17,388
POLONIUS: 'Tis most true, and he
beseeched me to entreat your majesties...

1556
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:20,516
-...to hear and see the matter.
-With all my heart.

1557
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:23,227
And it doth much content me
to hear him so inclined.

1558
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:25,271
Good gentlemen,
give him a further edge...

1559
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:28,858
-...and drive his purpose into these delights.
-We shall, my lord.

1560
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:33,696
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too...

1561
01:31:33,864 --> 01:31:36,157
...for we have closely sent
for Hamlet hither...

1562
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:40,035
..that he, as 'twere by accident, may here
affront Ophelia.

1563
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:44,248
Her father and myself, lawful espials,
will so bestow ourselves...

1564
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:49,086
...that, seeing unseen,
we may of their encounter frankly judge...

1565
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:54,216
...and gather by him, as he is behaved,
If't be th' affliction of his love or no...

1566
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:56,760
...that thus he suffers for.

1567
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:59,305
I shall obey you.

1568
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:03,267
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish...

1569
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:07,479
...that your good beauties
be the happy cause of Hamlet's wildness.

1570
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:13,485
So shall I hope your virtues
will bring him to his wonted way again...

1571
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:15,487
...to both your honors.

1572
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:19,033
Madam, I wish it may.

1573
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:24,914
POLONIUS:
Ophelia, walk you here--

1574
01:32:25,081 --> 01:32:27,291
Gracious, so please you
we will bestow ourselves.

1575
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:28,542
--read on this book...

1576
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:31,462
...that show of such an exercise
may color your loneliness.

1577
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,088
We are oft to blame in this.

1578
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:36,467
'Tis too much proved that with
devotion's visage and pious action...

1579
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,385
...we do sugar o'er the devil himself.

1580
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,888
O 'tis too true.

1581
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:46,310
How smart a lash that speech
doth give my conscience.

1582
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:49,230
The harlot's cheek,
beautied with plast'ring art...

1583
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:53,817
...is not more ugly
to the thing that helps it...

1584
01:32:53,985 --> 01:33:00,241
...than is my deed
to my most painted word.

1585
01:33:01,993 --> 01:33:04,161
O heavy burden.

1586
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:07,581
POLONIUS: I hear him coming.
Let's withdraw, my lord.

1587
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:48,038
To be, or not to be...

1588
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:51,625
...that is the question:

1589
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:55,713
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer...

1590
01:33:55,880 --> 01:34:00,217
...the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...

1591
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:03,178
...or to take arms
against a sea of troubles...

1592
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:05,723
...and by opposing, end them.

1593
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:08,642
To die, to sleep.

1594
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:10,185
No more...

1595
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:13,522
...and by a sleep to say we end...

1596
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,984
...the heartache
and the thousand natural shocks...

1597
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:19,069
...that flesh is heir to.

1598
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:23,615
'Tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished.

1599
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:26,452
To die...

1600
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:28,620
...to sleep.

1601
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,415
To sleep...

1602
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,459
...perchance to dream.

1603
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:36,045
Ay, there's the rub.

1604
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:39,006
For in that sleep of death...

1605
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:42,384
...what dreams may come...

1606
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:44,970
...when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil...

1607
01:34:45,138 --> 01:34:47,097
...must give us pause.

1608
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:52,353
There's the respect
that makes calamity of so long life.

1609
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:56,899
For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time...

1610
01:34:57,067 --> 01:35:03,030
...th' oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely...

1611
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:07,993
...the pangs of disprized love,
the law's delay...

1612
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:14,500
...the insolence of office, and the spurns
that patient merit of th' unworthy takes...

1613
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:19,296
...when he himself might his quietus make
with a bare bodkin?

1614
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:22,216
Who would fardels bear...

1615
01:35:22,384 --> 01:35:27,429
...to grunt and sweat
under a weary life...

1616
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:32,309
...but that the dread...

1617
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:36,647
...of something after death...

1618
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:41,318
...the undiscovered country...

1619
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:45,406
...from whose bourn no traveler returns...

1620
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:47,533
...puzzles the will...

1621
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:50,702
...and makes us rather bear
those ills we have...

1622
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:53,747
...than fly to others
that we know not of?

1623
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:57,334
Thus conscience...

1624
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:59,211
...doth make cowards of us all...

1625
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:03,340
...and thus the native hue of resolution...

1626
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:08,846
...is sicklied o'er
with the pale cast of thought...

1627
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:11,932
...and enterprises
of great pith and moment...

1628
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:18,397
...with this regard
their currents turn awry...

1629
01:36:18,565 --> 01:36:21,358
...and lose the name...

1630
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:24,987
...of action.

1631
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:26,488
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

1632
01:36:26,656 --> 01:36:29,658
Soft you now, the fair Ophelia.

1633
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:39,209
Nymph...

1634
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:42,629
...in thy orisons?

1635
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:47,468
-Be all my sins remembered?
OPHELIA: Good, my lord.

1636
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,636
How does your honor
for this many a day?

1637
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:53,056
I humbly thank you.

1638
01:36:54,809 --> 01:37:04,568
Well.

1639
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:21,001
My lord...

1640
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:25,547
... I have remembrances of yours...

1641
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:28,258
...that I have longed long to redeliver.

1642
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:31,345
I pray you now receive them.

1643
01:37:31,513 --> 01:37:32,804
No.

1644
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:36,225
Not I, I never gave you aught.

1645
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:38,435
My honored lord...

1646
01:37:39,145 --> 01:37:41,438
...you know right well you did...

1647
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:44,399
...and with them...

1648
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:47,611
...words of so sweet breath compos'd
as made the things more rich.

1649
01:37:47,946 --> 01:37:49,404
Their perfume lost...

1650
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:51,490
...take these again.

1651
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:56,078
For to the noble mind rich gifts
wax poor when givers prove unkind.

1652
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:58,288
There, my lord.

1653
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:02,042
Huh?

1654
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:05,295
-Are you honest?
-My lord?

1655
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:08,340
-Are you fair?
-What means your lordship?

1656
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:12,511
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty
should admit no discourse to your beauty.

1657
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:14,596
Could beauty better commerce
than honesty?

1658
01:38:14,764 --> 01:38:17,391
Truly, for the power of beauty
will transform honesty...

1659
01:38:17,559 --> 01:38:21,937
...from what it is to a bawd than honesty
can translate beauty into his likeness.

1660
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:26,149
This was sometime a paradox,
but now the time gives it proof.

1661
01:38:32,657 --> 01:38:34,074
I did love you once.

1662
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:38,036
Indeed, my lord,
you made me believe so.

1663
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:40,747
Well, you should not have believed me...

1664
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:44,334
...for virtue cannot so inoculate
our old stock but we shall relish of it.

1665
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:46,003
I loved you not.

1666
01:38:46,713 --> 01:38:50,299
-I was the more deceived.
-Get thee to a nunnery.

1667
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:52,384
Why wouldst thou be
a breeder of sinners?

But what of that?

-No, rather with choler.

Your wisdom should show
to signify this to his doctor.

For for me to put him to his purgation
might plunge him into far more choler.

It smells to heaven.

...a brother's murder.

Though inclination be as sharp as will...

2132
02:06:39,467 --> 02:06:43,303
...my stronger guilt
defeats my strong intent.

2133

And like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin...

but to confront the visage of offense?

2139
02:07:07,078 --> 02:07:13,000

to be forestalled ere we come to fall...

2140

...or pardoned being down?

2141

Then I’ll look up.

My fault is past.

But, O, what form of prayer
can serve my turn?

"Forgive me my foul murder"?

2145

That cannot be...

2146
02:07:31,769 --> 02:07:35,522

of those effects for which I did the murder:

...and my queen.

May one be pardoned
and retain the offense?

buys out the law.

2266
02:14:47,496 --> 02:14:49,456
But sure that sense is apoplexed.

2267
02:14:49,623 --> 02:14:51,249
For madness would not err...

2268
02:14:51,417 --> 02:14:55,587
...nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thralled
but it reserved some quantity of choice...

2269
02:14:55,755 --> 02:14:57,547
...to serve in such a difference.

2270
02:14:57,715 --> 02:15:01,843
What devil was't that thus
hath cozened you at hoodman-blind?

2271
02:15:02,011 --> 02:15:04,512
Eyes without feeling,
feeling without sight...

2272
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:07,348
...ears without hands or eyes,
smelling sans all...

2273
02:15:07,516 --> 02:15:13,062
...or but a sickly part of one true sense
could not so mope.

2274
02:15:15,024 --> 02:15:16,024
O shame...

2275
02:15:17,443 --> 02:15:19,068
...where is thy blush?

2276
02:15:20,029 --> 02:15:25,408
Rebellious hell,
if thou canst mutine in a matron's bones...

2277
02:15:25,576 --> 02:15:30,413
...to flaming youth let virtue be as wax
and melt in her own fire.

2278
02:15:30,581 --> 02:15:31,956
Proclaim no shame...

2279
02:15:32,124 --> 02:15:35,043
...when the compulsive ardor
gives the charge...

2280
02:15:35,211 --> 02:15:39,714
...since frost itself as actively doth burn,
and reason panders will.

2281
02:15:39,882 --> 02:15:43,426
O, Hamlet, speak no more.
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul...

2282
02:15:43,594 --> 02:15:45,929
...and there I see
such black and grained spots...

2283
02:15:46,096 --> 02:15:47,639
...as will not leave their tinct.

2284
02:15:47,807 --> 02:15:51,351
Nay, but to live
in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed...

2285
02:15:51,519 --> 02:15:55,563
...stewed in corruption, honeying
and making love over the nasty sty!

2286
02:15:55,731 --> 02:16:00,109
O, speak to me no more!
These words like daggers enter in my ears.

2287
02:16:00,277 --> 02:16:02,028
No more, sweet Hamlet.

2288
02:16:02,196 --> 02:16:03,404
A murderer and a villain...

2289
02:16:03,572 --> 02:16:08,827
...a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
of your precedent lord, a vice of kings...

2290
02:16:08,994 --> 02:16:11,329
...a cutpurse of the empire and the rule...

2291
02:16:11,497 --> 02:16:15,750
...that from a shelf the precious diadem
stole and put it in his pocket.

2292
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:19,879
-No more.
-A king of shreds and patches.

2293
02:16:28,722 --> 02:16:29,931
Save me...

2294
02:16:30,307 --> 02:16:33,726
...and hover o'er me with your wings,
you heavenly guards.

2295
02:16:34,395 --> 02:16:36,938
What would your gracious figure?

2296
02:16:37,106 --> 02:16:38,481
Alas, he's mad.

2297
02:16:38,649 --> 02:16:43,194
Do you not come
your tardy son to chide...

2298
02:16:43,529 --> 02:16:47,448
...that, lapsed in time and passion,
lets go by...

2299
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:52,370
...the important acting
of your dread command?

2300
02:16:52,746 --> 02:16:53,997
O, say.

2301
02:16:54,164 --> 02:16:56,666
[WHISPERS]
Do not forget.

2302
02:16:57,084 --> 02:17:01,462
This visitation is but to whet...

2303
02:17:01,630 --> 02:17:05,800
...thy almost blunted purpose.

2304
02:17:05,968 --> 02:17:07,969
But look...

2305
02:17:08,137 --> 02:17:12,015
...amazement on thy mother sits.

2306
02:17:12,182 --> 02:17:17,729
O, step between her and her fighting soul.

2307
02:17:17,897 --> 02:17:22,150
Conceit in weakest bodies...

2308
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:25,653
...strongest works.

2309
02:17:25,821 --> 02:17:28,573
Speak to her, Hamlet.

2310
02:17:28,991 --> 02:17:31,618
How is it with you, lady?

2311
02:17:31,785 --> 02:17:34,162
Alas, how is't with you...

2312
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:36,706
...that you do bend your eye
on vacancy...

2313
02:17:36,874 --> 02:17:40,710
...and with th' incorporal air
do hold discourse?

2314
02:17:42,254 --> 02:17:44,714
Forth at your eyes
your spirits wildly peep.

2315
02:17:44,882 --> 02:17:46,966
And as the sleeping soldiers
in th' alarm...

2316
02:17:47,134 --> 02:17:50,720
...your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
start up and stand on end.

2317
02:17:51,138 --> 02:17:53,306
O gentle son...

2318
02:17:53,474 --> 02:17:58,895
...upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
sprinkle cool patience.

2319
02:18:01,023 --> 02:18:03,608
Whereon do you look?

2320
02:18:04,234 --> 02:18:09,530
On him.

2321
02:18:10,699 --> 02:18:13,076
Look you how pale he glares.

2322
02:18:13,243 --> 02:18:18,206
His form and cause conjoined,
preaching to stones...

2323
02:18:18,374 --> 02:18:19,874
...would make them capable.

2324
02:18:20,709 --> 02:18:22,335
Do not look upon me...

2325
02:18:22,503 --> 02:18:26,965
...lest with this piteous action you convert
my stern effects.

2326
02:18:27,132 --> 02:18:30,218
Then what I have to do
will want true color.

2327
02:18:30,386 --> 02:18:32,804
Tears perchance for blood.

2328
02:18:32,972 --> 02:18:35,515
-To whom do you speak this?
-Do you see nothing there?

2329
02:18:35,683 --> 02:18:37,892
Nothing at all, yet all that is I see.

2330
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:40,228
-Did you nothing hear?
-Nothing but ourselves.

2331
02:18:40,396 --> 02:18:42,647
Look you there! Look how it steals away!

2332
02:18:42,815 --> 02:18:45,066
My father, in his habit as he lived!

2333
02:18:45,234 --> 02:18:47,568
Look, where he goes, even now,
out at the portal.

2334
02:18:47,903 --> 02:18:50,780
This is the very coinage of your brain.

2335
02:18:50,948 --> 02:18:54,826
This bodiless creation ecstasy
is very cunning in.

2336
02:18:54,994 --> 02:18:57,120
Ecstasy.

2337
02:19:02,376 --> 02:19:07,422
My pulse, as yours,
doth temperately keep time...

2338
02:19:07,589 --> 02:19:09,590
...and makes as healthful music.

2339
02:19:09,758 --> 02:19:12,301
It is not madness that I have uttered.

2340
02:19:12,469 --> 02:19:15,722
Bring me to the test,
and I the matter will reword...

2341
02:19:15,889 --> 02:19:17,682
...which madness would gambol from.

2342
02:19:17,850 --> 02:19:20,643
Mother, for love of grace...

2343
02:19:20,811 --> 02:19:24,105
...lay not that flattering unction
to your soul...

2344
02:19:24,273 --> 02:19:28,484
...that not your trespass
but my madness speaks.

2345
02:19:28,652 --> 02:19:32,113
It will but skin and film
the ulcerous place...

2346
02:19:32,281 --> 02:19:37,076
...whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
infects unseen.

2347
02:19:37,244 --> 02:19:39,245
Confess yourself to heaven.

2348
02:19:39,413 --> 02:19:42,582
Repent what's past,
avoid what is to come...

2349
02:19:42,750 --> 02:19:45,251
...and do not spread
the compost on the weeds...

2350
02:19:45,419 --> 02:19:47,462
...to make them ranker.

2351
02:19:47,629 --> 02:19:49,714
Forgive me this my virtue...

2352
02:19:49,882 --> 02:19:55,595
...for in the fatness of these pursy times
virtue itself of vice must pardon beg...

2353
02:19:55,763 --> 02:19:59,098
...yea, curb and woo
for leave to do him good.

2354
02:19:59,266 --> 02:20:01,059
O Hamlet.

2355
02:20:02,811 --> 02:20:05,438
Thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

2356
02:20:05,606 --> 02:20:10,610
O, throw away the worser part of it,
and live the purer with the other haIf.

2357
02:20:11,111 --> 02:20:12,361
Good night.

2358
02:20:12,529 --> 02:20:15,323
But go not to my uncle's bed.

2359
02:20:15,491 --> 02:20:17,909
Assume a virtue if you have it not.

2360
02:20:18,077 --> 02:20:20,870
That monster custom,
who all sense doth eat...

2361
02:20:21,038 --> 02:20:23,331
...of habits devil, is angel yet in this...

2362
02:20:23,499 --> 02:20:28,211
...that to the use of actions fair and good
he likewise gives a frock or livery...

2363
02:20:28,378 --> 02:20:30,004
...that aptly is put on.

2364
02:20:30,172 --> 02:20:32,840
Refrain tonight,
and that shall lend a kind of easiness...

2365
02:20:33,008 --> 02:20:35,134
...to the next abstinence.
The next more easy.

2366
02:20:35,552 --> 02:20:38,012
For use almost can change
the stamp of nature...

2367
02:20:38,180 --> 02:20:39,680
...and either shame the devil...

2368
02:20:40,057 --> 02:20:42,642
...or throw him out
with wondrous potency.

2369
02:20:43,852 --> 02:20:45,561
Once more, good night.

2370
02:20:46,063 --> 02:20:49,232
And when you are desirous to be blest...

2371
02:20:50,442 --> 02:20:53,361
... I’ll blessing beg of you.

2372
02:20:54,863 --> 02:20:57,532
For this same lord, I do repent.

2373
02:20:57,699 --> 02:21:02,161
But heaven hath pleased is so
to punish me with this, and this with me...

2374
02:21:02,329 --> 02:21:06,207
...that I must be their scourge
and minister.

2375
02:21:07,167 --> 02:21:09,252
I will bestow him...

2376
02:21:10,129 --> 02:21:13,464
...and will answer well
the death I gave him.

2377
02:21:14,842 --> 02:21:17,093
So again, good night.

2378
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:21,889
I must be cruel only to be kind.

2379
02:21:22,558 --> 02:21:25,143
Thus bad begins...

2380
02:21:25,894 --> 02:21:27,895
...and worse remains behind.

2381
02:21:29,231 --> 02:21:31,983
One word more, good lady.

2382
02:21:32,151 --> 02:21:33,734
What shall I do?

2383
02:21:33,902 --> 02:21:37,655
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:

2384
02:21:38,157 --> 02:21:41,033
Let the bloat king
tempt you again to bed...

2385
02:21:41,201 --> 02:21:43,202
...pinch wanton on your cheek...

2386
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:46,914
...call you his mouse, and let him,
for a pair of reechy kisses...

2387
02:21:47,082 --> 02:21:49,667
...or paddling in your neck
with his damned fingers...

2388
02:21:49,835 --> 02:21:54,005
...make you to ravel all this matter out,
that I essentially am not in madness...

2389
02:21:54,173 --> 02:21:57,300
...but mad in craft.

2390
02:21:57,467 --> 02:22:00,094
'Twere good you let him know.

2391
02:22:00,262 --> 02:22:04,932
For who that's but a queen,
fair, sober, wise...

2392
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:08,019
...would from a paddock,
from a bat, a gib...

2393
02:22:08,187 --> 02:22:10,062
...such dear concernings hide?

2394
02:22:10,230 --> 02:22:11,564
Who would do so? No...

2395
02:22:11,732 --> 02:22:13,649
...in despite of sense and secrecy...

2396
02:22:13,817 --> 02:22:16,110
...unpeg the basket on the house's top...

2397
02:22:16,278 --> 02:22:20,198
...let the birds fly,
and like the famous ape...

2398
02:22:20,365 --> 02:22:24,452
...to try conclusions
in the basket creep...

2399
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:27,288
...and break your own neck down.

2400
02:22:27,456 --> 02:22:29,415
Be thou assured...

2401
02:22:30,959 --> 02:22:33,461
...if words be made of breath...

2402
02:22:33,629 --> 02:22:35,296
...and breath of life...

2403
02:22:35,464 --> 02:22:38,758
... I have no life to breathe
what thou hast said to me.

2404
02:22:39,426 --> 02:22:42,220
I must to England, you know that?

2405
02:22:43,513 --> 02:22:45,973
Alack, I had forgot.

2406
02:22:47,976 --> 02:22:49,477
'Tis so concluded on.

2407
02:22:49,645 --> 02:22:51,771
There's letters sealed.

2408
02:22:51,939 --> 02:22:53,689
And my two schoolfellows...

2409
02:22:53,857 --> 02:22:57,151
...whom I will trust
as I will adders fanged...

2410
02:22:57,319 --> 02:22:58,569
...they bear the mandate.

2411
02:22:58,737 --> 02:23:01,364
They must sweep my way
and marshal me to knavery.

2412
02:23:01,531 --> 02:23:03,032
Let it work.

2413
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:06,994
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
hoist with his own petard.

2414
02:23:07,162 --> 02:23:09,413
And it shall go hard...

2415
02:23:09,706 --> 02:23:14,752
...but I will delve one yard
below their mines...

2416
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:18,464
...and blow them at the moon.

2417
02:23:19,007 --> 02:23:24,929
O, 'tis most sweet
when in one line two crafts directly meet.

2418
02:23:25,514 --> 02:23:27,473
This man shall set me packing.

2419
02:23:27,641 --> 02:23:30,184

...and we shall jointly labor with your soul
to give it due content.

2880
02:52:02,813 --> 02:52:05,064
Let this be so.

2881
02:52:06,441 --> 02:52:09,902
His means of death...

2882
02:52:10,821 --> 02:52:13,739
...his obscure burial--

2883
02:52:14,282 --> 02:52:17,368
No trophy, sword,
nor hatchment o'er his bones...

2884
02:52:17,536 --> 02:52:23,249
...no noble rite nor formal ostentation.

2885
02:52:23,417 --> 02:52:26,210
--cry to be heard,
as 'twere from heaven to earth...

2886
02:52:26,378 --> 02:52:30,256
...that I must call 't in question.

2887
02:52:30,424 --> 02:52:32,633
So you shall.

2888
02:52:32,801 --> 02:52:37,722
And where th' offense is,
let the great ax fall.

2889
02:52:38,140 --> 02:52:40,516
I pray you, go with me.

2890
02:52:43,437 --> 02:52:45,312
HORATIO:
What are they that would speak with me?

2891
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:48,733
Sailors, sir.
They say they have letters for you.

2892
02:52:48,900 --> 02:52:51,652
[WATER SPLASHING
AND OPHELIA SCREAMING]

2893
02:53:11,381 --> 02:53:16,135
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted if not from Lord Hamlet.

2894
02:53:16,303 --> 02:53:18,137
MAN: God bless you.
-Let him bless thee too.

2895
02:53:18,305 --> 02:53:21,182
He shall, sir, an 't please him.
There's a letter for you, sir.

2896
02:53:21,349 --> 02:53:24,018
It comes from th' ambassador
that was bound for England...

2897
02:53:24,186 --> 02:53:26,979
...if your name be Horatio,
as I am led to know it is.

2898
02:53:29,107 --> 02:53:31,317
"Horatio, when thou shalt
have overlooked this...

2899
02:53:31,485 --> 02:53:35,279
...give these fellows some means
to the king. They have letters for him.

2900
02:53:36,323 --> 02:53:37,948
Ere we were two days old at sea...

2901
02:53:38,116 --> 02:53:42,453
...a pirate of very warlike appointment
gave us chase.

2902
02:53:42,621 --> 02:53:44,330
Finding ourselves too slow of sail...

2903
02:53:44,498 --> 02:53:47,958
...we put on a compelled valor,
and in the grapple I boarded them.

2904
02:53:48,126 --> 02:53:52,421
On the instant they got clear of our ship,
so I alone became their prisoner.

2905
02:53:52,589 --> 02:53:54,757
They have dealt with me
like thieves of mercy...

2906
02:53:54,925 --> 02:53:58,427
...but they knew what they did:
I am to do a good turn for them.

2907
02:53:58,595 --> 02:54:00,596
Let the king have the letters
I have sent...

2908
02:54:00,764 --> 02:54:04,892
...and repair thou to me with as much haste
as thou wouldst fly death.

2909
02:54:05,060 --> 02:54:08,771
I have words to speak in thine ear
will make thee dumb...

2910
02:54:08,939 --> 02:54:12,274
...yet they are much too light
for the bore of the matter.

2911
02:54:12,442 --> 02:54:15,111
These good fellows
will bring thee where I am.

2912
02:54:15,278 --> 02:54:19,532
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
hold their course for England.

2913
02:54:19,699 --> 02:54:23,202
Of them I have much to tell thee.
Farewell.

2914
02:54:23,370 --> 02:54:27,540
He that thou knowest thine, Hamlet."

2915
02:54:28,166 --> 02:54:30,501
Come, I will give you way
for these your letters...

2916
02:54:30,669 --> 02:54:33,003
...and do 't the speedier
that you may direct me...

2917
02:54:33,171 --> 02:54:35,131
...to him from whom you brought them.

2918
02:54:35,507 --> 02:54:38,509
Now must your conscience
my acquittance seal...

2919
02:54:38,677 --> 02:54:42,138
...and you must put me
in your heart for friend...

2920
02:54:42,305 --> 02:54:45,141
...since you have heard,
and with a knowing ear...

2921
02:54:45,308 --> 02:54:49,937
...that he which hath your noble father slain
pursued my life.

2922
02:54:50,105 --> 02:54:52,898
It well appears. But tell me...

2923
02:54:53,150 --> 02:54:55,734
...why you proceeded
not against these feats...

2924
02:54:55,902 --> 02:55:01,031
...so crimeful and so capital in nature,
as by your safety...

2925
02:55:01,199 --> 02:55:03,909
...wisdom, all things else,
you mainly were stirred up.

2926
02:55:04,077 --> 02:55:09,665
O, for two special reasons
which may to you seem much unsinewed...

2927
02:55:09,833 --> 02:55:11,584
...but yet to me they're strong.

2928
02:55:11,751 --> 02:55:16,297
The queen his mother
lives almost by his looks.

2929
02:55:16,590 --> 02:55:17,840
And for myself--

2930
02:55:18,008 --> 02:55:22,303
My virtue or my plague,
be it either which.

2931
02:55:22,971 --> 02:55:27,266
--she is so conjunctive
to my life and soul...

2932
02:55:27,434 --> 02:55:31,020
...that, as the star moves not
but in his sphere...

2933
02:55:31,188 --> 02:55:34,106
... I could not but by her.

2934
02:55:34,983 --> 02:55:38,110
The other motive
why to a public count I might not go...

2935
02:55:38,278 --> 02:55:41,697
...is the great love
the general gender bear him...

2936
02:55:41,865 --> 02:55:44,283
...who, dipping all his faults
in their affection...

2937
02:55:44,451 --> 02:55:46,952
...would, like the spring
that turneth wood to stone...

2938
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:49,163
...convert his gyves to graces...

2939
02:55:49,331 --> 02:55:52,458
...so that my arrows,
too slightly timbered for so loud a wind...

2940
02:55:52,626 --> 02:55:56,921
...would have reverted to my bow again,
but not where I had aimed them.

2941
02:55:57,964 --> 02:56:01,258
And so have I a noble father lost.

2942
02:56:01,968 --> 02:56:04,386
A sister driven into desp'rate terms...

2943
02:56:04,554 --> 02:56:07,139
...whose worth,
if praises may go back again...

2944
02:56:07,307 --> 02:56:11,727
...stood challenger, on mount...

2945
02:56:12,437 --> 02:56:16,315
...of all the age for her perfections.

2946
02:56:18,818 --> 02:56:23,155
-But my revenge will come.
-Break not your sleeps for that.

2947
02:56:23,323 --> 02:56:26,242
You must not think
that we are made of stuff so flat and dull...

2948
02:56:26,409 --> 02:56:29,787
...that we can let our beard be shook
with danger, and think it pastime.

2949
02:56:29,955 --> 02:56:32,581
You shortly shall hear more.

2950
02:56:33,375 --> 02:56:38,921
I loved your father, and we love ourself.

2951
02:56:39,089 --> 02:56:42,299
And that, I hope,
will teach you to imagine--

2952
02:56:42,467 --> 02:56:45,094
CLAUDIUS:
How now? What news?

2953
02:56:45,804 --> 02:56:48,347
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.

2954
02:56:48,515 --> 02:56:50,724
This is to Your Majesty,
this to the queen.

2955
02:56:50,892 --> 02:56:52,851
From Hamlet? Who brought them?

2956
02:56:53,019 --> 02:56:55,938
Sailors, my lord, they say.
I saw them not.

2957
02:56:56,106 --> 02:56:58,357
They were given me by Claudio.

2958
02:56:58,525 --> 02:57:01,151
He received them
of him that brought them.

2959
02:57:01,319 --> 02:57:04,196
CLAUDIUS: Laertes, you shall hear them.
Leave us.

2960
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:11,453
"High and mighty, you shall know
that I am set naked on your kingdom.

2961
02:57:11,621 --> 02:57:14,164
Tomorrow shall I beg leave
to see your kingly eyes...

2962
02:57:14,332 --> 02:57:17,876
...when I shall, first asking your pardon,
thereunto recount th' occasions...

2963
02:57:18,044 --> 02:57:21,380
...of my sudden and more strange return.
Hamlet."

2964
02:57:21,548 --> 02:57:23,173
What should this mean?

2965
02:57:23,341 --> 02:57:26,552
Are all the rest come back?
Or is this some abuse, and no such thing?

2966
02:57:26,720 --> 02:57:30,055
-Know you the hand?
-'Tis Hamlet's character.

2967
02:57:30,223 --> 02:57:33,726
"Naked," and in a postscript here
he says "alone."

2968
02:57:33,893 --> 02:57:37,438
-Can you advise me?
-I'm lost in it, my lord.

2969
02:57:38,398 --> 02:57:40,733
But let him come.

2970
02:57:41,568 --> 02:57:46,071
It warms the very sickness in my heart
that I shall live and tell him to his teeth:

2971
02:57:46,239 --> 02:57:47,489
"Thus diest thou."

2972
02:57:47,824 --> 02:57:51,785
If it be so, Laertes--
As how should it be so, how otherwise?

2973
02:57:51,953 --> 02:57:53,162
--will you be ruled by me?

2974
02:57:53,330 --> 02:57:55,956
Ay, my lord,
if so you'll not o'errule me to a peace.

2975
02:57:56,124 --> 02:57:58,167
To thine own peace.

2976
02:57:58,460 --> 02:58:00,794
If he be now returned,
as checking at his voyage...

2977
02:58:00,962 --> 02:58:03,088
...and that he means
no more to undertake it...

2978
02:58:03,256 --> 02:58:05,924
... I will work him to an exploit,
now ripe in my device...

2979
02:58:06,092 --> 02:58:09,928
...under the which
he shall not choose but fall.

2980
02:58:10,638 --> 02:58:12,681
And for his death...

2981
02:58:12,849 --> 02:58:15,100
...no wind of blame shall breathe.

2982
02:58:15,268 --> 02:58:18,270
Even his mother shall uncharge the practice
and call it accident.

2983
02:58:18,438 --> 02:58:19,897
My lord, I will be ruled.

2984
02:58:20,065 --> 02:58:23,025
The rather if you could devise it so
that I might be the organ.

2985
02:58:23,193 --> 02:58:24,943
It falls right.

2986
02:58:25,111 --> 02:58:27,780
You have been talked of
since your travels much--

2987
02:58:27,947 --> 02:58:29,365
And that in Hamlet's hearing.

2988
02:58:29,532 --> 02:58:31,950
--for a quality
wherein they say you shine.

2989
02:58:32,118 --> 02:58:34,995
Your sum of parts did not together
pluck such envy from him...

2990
02:58:35,163 --> 02:58:39,500
...as did that one, and that, in my regard,
of the unworthiest siege.

2991
02:58:39,667 --> 02:58:42,795
-What part is that, my lord?
-A very ribbon in the cap of youth...

2992
02:58:42,962 --> 02:58:44,171
...yet needful too.

2993
02:58:44,339 --> 02:58:48,008
For youth no less becomes
the light and careless livery that it wears...

2994
02:58:48,176 --> 02:58:54,431
...than settled age his sables and his weeds,
importing health and graveness.

2995
02:58:55,308 --> 02:58:59,144
Two months since
here was a gentleman of Normandy.

2996
02:58:59,312 --> 02:59:01,730
I have seen myself,
and served against, the French...

2997
02:59:01,898 --> 02:59:06,151
...and they can well on horseback,
but this gallant had witchcraft in 't.

2998
02:59:06,319 --> 02:59:08,028
He grew into his seat...

2999
02:59:08,196 --> 02:59:10,489
...and to such wondrous
doing brought his horse...

3000
02:59:10,657 --> 02:59:13,826
...as he had he been incorpsed
and deminatured with the brave beast.

3001
02:59:13,993 --> 02:59:17,913
So far he topped my thought
that I in forgery of shapes and tricks...

3002
02:59:18,081 --> 02:59:20,916
...come short of what he did.

3003
02:59:21,918 --> 02:59:24,128
-A Norman was 't?
-A Norman.

3004
02:59:24,295 --> 02:59:26,296
-Upon my life, Lamord.
-The very same.

3005
02:59:26,464 --> 02:59:30,342
I know him well. He is the brooch indeed
and gem of all our nation.

3006
02:59:30,510 --> 02:59:31,969
He made confession of you...

3007
02:59:32,137 --> 02:59:36,682
...and gave you such a masterly report
for art and exercise in your defense...

3008
02:59:36,850 --> 02:59:39,184
...and for your rapier most especial...

3009
02:59:39,352 --> 02:59:42,479
...that he cried out 'twould be sight indeed
if one could match you.

3010
02:59:42,647 --> 02:59:46,275
The scrimers of their nation, he swore,
had neither motion, guard, nor eye...

3011
02:59:46,443 --> 02:59:48,652
...if you opposed them, sir.

3012
02:59:48,820 --> 02:59:52,865
This report of his
did Hamlet so envenom with his envy...

3013
02:59:53,032 --> 02:59:55,200
...that he could nothing do
but wish and beg...

3014
02:59:55,368 --> 02:59:58,036
...your sudden coming o'er
to play with him.

3015
02:59:58,204 --> 03:00:01,290
-Now, out of this--
-What out of this, my lord?

3016
03:00:01,458 --> 03:00:03,959
Laertes, was your father dear to you?

3017
03:00:04,127 --> 03:00:08,130
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
a face without a heart?

3018
03:00:08,298 --> 03:00:09,506
Why ask you this?

3019
03:00:09,674 --> 03:00:13,010
Not that I think
you did not love your father...

3020
03:00:13,178 --> 03:00:17,764
...but that I know
love is begun by time...

3021
03:00:18,183 --> 03:00:21,560
...and that I see, in passages of proof...

3022
03:00:21,728 --> 03:00:25,147
...time qualifies the spark and fire of it.

3023
03:00:25,315 --> 03:00:28,317
There lives
within the very flame of love...

3024
03:00:28,485 --> 03:00:33,071
...a kind of wick or snuff
that will abate it.

3025
03:00:33,239 --> 03:00:35,741

03:19:37,674 --> 03:19:40,426
Her death was doubtful...

3325
03:19:40,594 --> 03:19:43,095
...and but that great command
o'ersways the order...

3326
03:19:43,263 --> 03:19:47,725
...she should in ground unsanctified
have lodged till the last trumpet.

3327
03:19:48,226 --> 03:19:52,897
For charitable prayers, shards, flints,
and pebbles should be thrown on her.

3328
03:19:53,065 --> 03:19:56,400
Yet here she has her virgin rites,
her maiden strewments...

3329
03:19:56,568 --> 03:19:58,778
...and the bringing home
of bell and burial.

3330
03:19:58,945 --> 03:20:00,321
Must there no more be done?

3331
03:20:00,489 --> 03:20:02,156
No more be done.

3332
03:20:02,616 --> 03:20:04,700
PRIEST: We should profane
the service of the dead...

3333
03:20:04,868 --> 03:20:09,455
...to sing sage requiem and such rest to her
as to peace-parted souls.

3334

Lay her i' th' earth.

3335
03:20:15,295 --> 03:20:21,092
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
may violets spring.

3336
03:20:21,259 --> 03:20:22,593
I tell thee, churlish priest...

...a minist'ring angel shall my sister be
when thou liest howling.

...deprived thee of.

[SHOUTS]
Hold off the earth awhile...

3350

...till I have caught her once more
in mine arms.

3351

Now pile your dust
upon the quick and dead...

...till of this flat a mountain you have made
to o'ertop old Pelion...

...or the skyish head of blue Olympus!

3354
03:21:16,648 --> 03:21:20,901
HAMLET: What is he whose grief
bears such an emphasis...

3355
03:21:21,069 --> 03:21:24,155
...whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wand'ring stars...

3356
03:21:24,322 --> 03:21:27,658
...and makes them stand
like wonder-wounded hearers?

This is I, Hamlet the Dane!

[GRUNTING]

I am not splenitive and rash...

which let thy wisdom fear.

-Hold off thy hand.
-Pluck them asunder.

Good my lord, be quiet.

I’ll fight with him upon this theme
until my eyelids no longer wag.

O my son, what theme?

3368
03:21:55,520 --> 03:21:58,355
I loved Ophelia.

3369
03:21:58,523 --> 03:22:01,734
Forty thousand brothers could not,
with all their quantity of love...

...make up my sum.

-What wilt thou do for her?
-O, he is mad, Laertes.

3372
03:22:06,239 --> 03:22:08,991
For love of God, forbear him.

'Swounds, show me what a thou'lt do.

Dost thou come here to whine,
to outface me with leaping in her grave?

Be buried quick with her, and so will l.

Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
I’ll rant as well as thou.

Hear you, sir.

03:22:51,993 --> 03:22:54,537
HAMLET:
What is the reason that you use me thus?

3389
03:22:55,622 --> 03:22:57,915
I loved you ever.

3390

But it is no matter.

CLAUDIUS:
Good Gertrude...

3398

...set some watch over your son.

An hour of quiet shortly shall we see.

Till then, in patience our proceeding be.

3402
03:24:17,829 --> 03:24:20,915
So much for this, sir.
Now shall you see the other.

3403
03:24:21,082 --> 03:24:23,876
-You do remember all the circumstance?
-Remember it, my lord.

3404
03:24:24,044 --> 03:24:27,963
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
that would not let me sleep.

3405
03:24:28,131 --> 03:24:30,758
Methought I lay
worse than the mutines in the bilboes.

3406
03:24:30,926 --> 03:24:33,761
Rashly, and praised be rashness for it...

...let us know our indiscretion
sometimes serve us well...

-Rough-hew them how we will.
-That is most certain.

3411
03:24:50,695 --> 03:24:53,697
Up from my cabin, my sea-gown
scarfed about me in the dark...

3412
03:24:53,865 --> 03:24:57,368
...groped I to find out them, had my desire,
fingered their packet...

3413
03:24:57,535 --> 03:24:59,912
...and in fine withdrew
to mine own room again...

3414
03:25:00,080 --> 03:25:03,374
...making so bold,
my fears forgetting manners...

3415
03:25:03,541 --> 03:25:09,088
...to unseal their grand commission,
where I found, Horatio--

3416

O royal knavery.

3417
03:25:11,591 --> 03:25:16,220
--an exact command,
larded with many several sorts of reasons...

and England's too, with ho!

-...my head should be struck off.
-Is 't possible?

Here's the commission,
read it at more leisure.

3423
03:25:33,071 --> 03:25:35,698
-But wilt thou hear how I did proceed?
-I beseech you.

3424
03:25:35,865 --> 03:25:38,742
Being thus benetted round
with villainies--

3425
03:25:38,910 --> 03:25:41,954
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains...

3426
03:25:42,122 --> 03:25:44,081
...they had begun the play.

3427

--I sat me down,
devised a new commission, wrote it fair.

-Wilt thou know th' effect of what I wrote?
-Ah, good.

3432
03:26:02,267 --> 03:26:04,935
An earnest conjuration from the king...

3433
03:26:05,103 --> 03:26:07,730
...as England was his faithful tributary...

3434
03:26:07,897 --> 03:26:10,566
...as love between them
like the palm might flourish...

3435
03:26:10,734 --> 03:26:13,277
...as peace should still
her wheaten garland wear...

3436
03:26:13,445 --> 03:26:15,487
...and stand a comma
'tween their amities...

3437
03:26:15,655 --> 03:26:19,241
...and many such like as-es
of great charge...

...that on the view
and know of these contents...

...without debatement further
more or less...

...he should those bearers
put to sudden death.

-Not shriving-time allowed.
-How was this sealed?

3442
03:26:33,089 --> 03:26:34,882
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.

3443
03:26:35,050 --> 03:26:37,301

...which was the model
of that Danish seal.

3445

Folded the writ up
in the form of th' other...

3446

...Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to 't.

3452
03:26:58,907 --> 03:27:02,743
Why, man, they did make love
to this employment.

3453
03:27:02,911 --> 03:27:05,037
They are not near my conscience.

3454
03:27:05,205 --> 03:27:08,999
Their defeat
does by their own insinuation grow.

3455

'Tis dangerous
when the baser nature comes...

of mighty opposites.

Why, what a king is this.

Does it not, think'st thee,
stand me now upon--

He that hath killed my king
and whored my mother...

...popped in between th' election
and my hopes...

...to let this canker of our nature come
in further evil?

3465
03:27:40,198 --> 03:27:42,032
lt must be shortly known to him
from England...

3466
03:27:42,200 --> 03:27:44,368
...what is the issue of the business there.

3467
03:27:44,536 --> 03:27:46,537
It will be short.

...no more than to say "one."

03:27:59,676 --> 03:28:05,055
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
that to Laertes I forgot myself.

3472

I see the portraiture of his.

03:28:11,020 --> 03:28:13,564
I’ll court his favors.

3474
03:28:13,731 --> 03:28:14,773
[SIGHS]

3475
03:28:14,941 --> 03:28:19,236
But sure, the bravery of his grief
did put me into a tow'ring passion.

3476
03:28:19,404 --> 03:28:22,698
Peace, who comes here?

3477
03:28:26,536 --> 03:28:28,704
Your lordship is right welcome back
to Denmark.

3478
03:28:28,955 --> 03:28:29,955
I humbly thank you, sir.

3479
03:28:30,123 --> 03:28:32,749
HAMLET: Dost know this water-fly?
HORATIO: No, my lord.

3480
03:28:32,917 --> 03:28:35,669
Thy state is the more gracious,
for 'tis a vice to know him.

3481
03:28:35,837 --> 03:28:37,880
He hath much land, and fertile.

3482
03:28:38,047 --> 03:28:41,675
Let a beast be lord of beasts,
and his crib shall stand at the king's mess.

3483
03:28:41,843 --> 03:28:46,221
'Tis a chuff, but, as I say,
spacious in the possession of dirt.

3484
03:28:46,598 --> 03:28:47,598
OSRlC:
Sweet lord...

3485
03:28:47,765 --> 03:28:52,186
...if your friendship were at leisure, I should
impart a thing to you from His Majesty.

3486
03:28:52,353 --> 03:28:54,813
I will receive it, sir,
with all diligence of spirit.

3487
03:28:54,981 --> 03:28:57,482
Uh, put your bonnet to its right use.
'Tis for the head.

3488
03:28:57,650 --> 03:29:00,027
I thank your lordship, but 'tis very hot.

3489
03:29:00,195 --> 03:29:02,196
No, 'tis very cold. The wind is northerly.

3490
03:29:02,363 --> 03:29:04,948
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

3491
03:29:05,116 --> 03:29:09,203
But yet methinks it is very sultry
and hot for my complexion.

3492
03:29:09,370 --> 03:29:11,455
Ha, exceedingly, my lord.

3493
03:29:11,623 --> 03:29:15,667
It is very sultry, as 'twere--
I cannot tell how, ha-ha.

3494
03:29:15,835 --> 03:29:18,712
But, my lord, His Majesty bade me
signify to you...

3495
03:29:18,880 --> 03:29:21,089
...that he hath laid a great wager
on your head.

3496
03:29:21,507 --> 03:29:24,134
OSRIC: Sir, this is the matter.
-I beseech you, remember.

3497
03:29:25,929 --> 03:29:29,014
Nay, good my lord,
for mine ease, in good faith.

3498
03:29:29,307 --> 03:29:33,060
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes.

3499
03:29:33,228 --> 03:29:36,480
Believe me, an absolute gentleman...

3500
03:29:36,648 --> 03:29:41,610
...full of most excellent differences,
of very soft society and great showing.

3501
03:29:41,778 --> 03:29:46,782
Indeed, to speak feelingly of him,
he is the card or calendar of gentry.

3502
03:29:46,950 --> 03:29:51,036
For you shall find in him the continent
of what part a gentleman would see.

3503
03:29:51,204 --> 03:29:53,705
Sir, his definement
suffers no perdition in you.

3504
03:29:53,873 --> 03:29:55,832
HAMLET: Though I know
to divide him inventorially...

3505
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:59,920
...would dizzy th' arithmetic of memory
and yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.

3506
03:30:00,088 --> 03:30:03,340
In the verity of extolment,
I take him to be a soul of great article...

3507
03:30:03,508 --> 03:30:07,094
...and his infusion of dearth and rareness,
as to make true diction of him...

3508
03:30:07,262 --> 03:30:08,804
...his semblable is his mirror...

3509
03:30:08,972 --> 03:30:12,057
...and who else would trace him,
his umbrage, nothing more.

3510
03:30:12,225 --> 03:30:15,352
Your lordship speaks
most infallibly of him.

3511
03:30:18,147 --> 03:30:19,940
The concernancy, sir?

3512
03:30:20,441 --> 03:30:22,359
Why do we wrap the gentleman...

3513
03:30:22,527 --> 03:30:25,779
-...in our more rawer breath?
-Sir?

3514
03:30:26,072 --> 03:30:29,074
Is 't not possible to understand
in another tongue?

3515
03:30:29,242 --> 03:30:30,534
You will to 't sire, really.

3516
03:30:30,702 --> 03:30:33,495
What imports the nomination
of this gentleman?

3517
03:30:33,663 --> 03:30:35,706
-Of Laertes?
-His purse is empty already.

3518
03:30:35,873 --> 03:30:37,499
All's golden words are spent.

3519
03:30:37,667 --> 03:30:40,043
-Of him, sir.
-I know you're not ignorant--

3520
03:30:40,211 --> 03:30:43,755
I would you did. Yet in faith if you did,
it would not much approve me. Well?

3521
03:30:43,923 --> 03:30:46,300
You are not ignorant
of what excellence Laertes is.

3522
03:30:46,467 --> 03:30:49,386
I dare not confess that,
lest I compare with him in excellence.

3523
03:30:49,554 --> 03:30:51,555
But to know a man well
were to know himself.

3524
03:30:51,723 --> 03:30:53,223
I mean, sir, for his weapon.

3525
03:30:53,391 --> 03:30:57,227
But in the imputation laid on him by them,
in his meed, he's unfellowed.

3526
03:30:57,395 --> 03:30:58,979
-What's his weapon?
-Rapier and dagger.

3527
03:30:59,147 --> 03:31:00,772
-That's two of his weapons. But well.
-Ha.

3528
03:31:00,940 --> 03:31:04,609
The king, sir, hath wagered
with him six Barbary horses...

3529
03:31:04,777 --> 03:31:07,321
-...against the which he has imponed--
-Imponed?

3530
03:31:07,488 --> 03:31:10,741
--as I take it, six French rapiers
and poniards...

3531
03:31:10,908 --> 03:31:14,578
...with their assigns,
as girdle, hanger, or so.

3532
03:31:14,746 --> 03:31:18,081
Three of the carriages, in faith,
are very dear to fancy...

3533
03:31:18,249 --> 03:31:20,542
...very responsive to the hilts...

3534
03:31:20,710 --> 03:31:24,546
...most delicate carriages,
and of very liberal conceit.

3535
03:31:24,714 --> 03:31:26,840
What call you the carriages?

3536
03:31:27,008 --> 03:31:29,718
I knew you must be edified
by the margin ere you had done.

3537
03:31:29,886 --> 03:31:31,970
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

3538
03:31:32,138 --> 03:31:35,432
The phrase would be more germane
if we could carry cannon by our sides.

3539
03:31:35,600 --> 03:31:37,601
-I would it might be hangers till then.
-Ah, ha!

3540
03:31:37,769 --> 03:31:40,729
But on: six Barbary horses
against six French swords...

3541
03:31:40,897 --> 03:31:44,691
...their assigns,
and three liberal-conceited...

3542
03:31:44,859 --> 03:31:46,818
-Carriages.
-...carriages.

3543
03:31:46,986 --> 03:31:51,865
That's the French bet against the Danish.
Why is this "imponed," as you call it?

3544
03:31:52,033 --> 03:31:55,702
The king, sir, hath laid, sir, that
in a dozen passes between you and him...

3545
03:31:55,870 --> 03:31:58,413
...he shall not exceed you three hits.

3546
03:31:58,581 --> 03:32:00,374
He hath laid on 12 for nine.

3547
03:32:00,541 --> 03:32:02,459
And it would come to immediate trial...

3548
03:32:02,627 --> 03:32:05,087
...if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer.

3549
03:32:06,714 --> 03:32:08,632
How if I answer no?

3550
03:32:09,801 --> 03:32:13,387
I mean, my lord,
the opposition of your person in trial.

3551
03:32:14,722 --> 03:32:16,556
Sir, I will walk here in the hall.

3552
03:32:16,724 --> 03:32:19,684
If it please His Majesty,
'tis the breathing time of day with me.

3553
03:32:19,852 --> 03:32:21,019
Let the foils be brought.

3554
03:32:21,187 --> 03:32:23,730
The gentleman willing,
and the king hold his purpose...

3555
03:32:23,898 --> 03:32:26,316
... I will win for him and I can.

3556
03:32:26,484 --> 03:32:31,405
If not, I shall gain nothing but my shame
and the odd hits.

3557
03:32:32,323 --> 03:32:35,325
-Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
-To this effect, sir.

3558
03:32:35,493 --> 03:32:38,829
After what flourish your nature will.

3559
03:32:39,122 --> 03:32:40,997
I commend my duty to your lordship.

3560
03:32:41,249 --> 03:32:42,707
Yours, yours.

3561
03:32:44,001 --> 03:32:45,252
HAMLET:
Um....

3562
03:32:57,306 --> 03:33:00,684
He does well to commend it himself,
there are no tongues else for 's turn.

3563
03:33:00,852 --> 03:33:03,145
This lapwing runs away
with the shell on his head.

3564
03:33:03,312 --> 03:33:06,022
He did comply with his dug
before he sucked it.

3565
03:33:06,190 --> 03:33:10,861
Thus has he-- And many more of the same
bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on.

3566
03:33:11,028 --> 03:33:14,990
--only got the tune of the time
and outward habit of encounter...

3567
03:33:15,158 --> 03:33:16,783
...a kind of yeasty collection...

3568
03:33:16,951 --> 03:33:20,704
...which carries them through and through
the most fanned and winnowed opinions...

3569
03:33:20,872 --> 03:33:24,666
...and do but blow them to their trial,
the bubbles are out.

3570
03:33:33,634 --> 03:33:34,926
My lord.

3571
03:33:35,094 --> 03:33:38,221
His Majesty commended him to you
by young Osric...

3572
03:33:38,389 --> 03:33:41,766
...who brings back to him,
that you attend him in the hall.

3573
03:33:41,934 --> 03:33:45,937
He sends to know if your pleasure hold
to play with Laertes...

3574
03:33:46,105 --> 03:33:49,441
-...or that you will take longer time.
-I am constant to my purposes.

3575
03:33:49,609 --> 03:33:53,695
They follow the king's pleasure:
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready.

3576
03:33:53,863 --> 03:33:56,948
Now or whensoever,
provided I be so able as now.

3577
03:33:57,116 --> 03:33:59,367
The king and queen and all
are coming down.

3578
03:33:59,535 --> 03:34:00,911
In happy time.

3579
03:34:01,078 --> 03:34:04,206
The queen desires you
to some gentle entertainment to Laertes...

3580
03:34:04,373 --> 03:34:05,707
...before you fall to play.

3581
03:34:06,250 --> 03:34:07,792
She well instructs me.

3582
03:34:16,093 --> 03:34:18,762
You will lose this wager, my lord.

3583
03:34:23,267 --> 03:34:25,519
I do not think so.

3584
03:34:25,853 --> 03:34:30,232
Since he went into France,
I have been in continual practice.

3585
03:34:30,858 --> 03:34:33,944
I shall win at the odds.

3586
03:34:35,863 --> 03:34:40,825
But thou wouldst not think
how ill all's here about my heart.

3587
03:34:41,327 --> 03:34:42,786
[SIGHS]

3588
03:34:42,954 --> 03:34:44,496
But it is no matter.

3589
03:34:44,664 --> 03:34:46,873
Nay, good my lord.

3590
03:34:47,041 --> 03:34:49,042
HAMLET:
It is but foolery.

3591
03:34:50,419 --> 03:34:55,423
But it is such a kind of gain-giving
as would perhaps trouble a woman.

3592
03:34:55,800 --> 03:34:59,928
If your mind dislike anything, obey it.

3593
03:35:00,471 --> 03:35:03,473
I will forestall their repair hither,
and say you are not fit.

3594
03:35:03,641 --> 03:35:05,392
Not a whit.

3595
03:35:06,477 --> 03:35:09,145
We defy augury.

3596
03:35:11,482 --> 03:35:15,860
There is a special providence
in the fall of a sparrow.

3597
03:35:17,321 --> 03:35:20,323
If it be now, 'tis not to come.

3598
03:35:21,659 --> 03:35:24,744
If it be not to come, it will be now.

3599
03:35:26,122 --> 03:35:28,415
If it be not now...

3600
03:35:30,876 --> 03:35:34,087
...yet it will come.

3601
03:35:35,715 --> 03:35:38,216
The readiness is all.

3602
03:35:39,135 --> 03:35:43,138
Since no man knows aught
of what he leaves...

3603
03:35:45,141 --> 03:35:47,892
...what is 't to leave betimes?

3604
03:35:50,813 --> 03:35:52,856
Let be.

3605
03:36:19,508 --> 03:36:24,220
Come, Hamlet, come,
and take this hand from me.

3606
03:36:26,641 --> 03:36:28,892
Give me your pardon, sir.

3607
03:36:29,644 --> 03:36:32,062
I have done you wrong.

3608
03:36:32,647 --> 03:36:34,439
But pardon 't as you're a gentleman.

3609
03:36:34,899 --> 03:36:37,567
HAMLET: This presence knows,
and you must needs have heard...

3610
03:36:37,735 --> 03:36:40,487
...how I am punished
with a sore distraction.

3611
03:36:40,655 --> 03:36:45,617
What I have done that might your nature,
honor, and exception roughly awake...

3612
03:36:45,785 --> 03:36:48,411
...I here proclaim was madness.

3613
03:36:48,579 --> 03:36:51,748
Was 't Hamlet wronged Laertes?
Never Hamlet.

3614
03:36:52,416 --> 03:36:56,378
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away, and
when he's not himself does wrong Laertes...

3615
03:36:56,545 --> 03:36:59,673
...then Hamlet does it not,
Hamlet denies it.

3616
03:36:59,840 --> 03:37:00,924
Who does it, then?

3617
03:37:02,426 --> 03:37:04,094
His madness.

3618
03:37:04,261 --> 03:37:07,681
If 't be so, Hamlet is of the faction
that is wronged.

3619
03:37:07,848 --> 03:37:10,392
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.

3620
03:37:11,352 --> 03:37:14,938
HAMLET: Sir, in this audience,
